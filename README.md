# hospital-pharmacy-analysis
Power BI project analyzing hospital patient visits and pharmacy transactions to identify disease trends, revenue patterns, and medication usage across counties.

## Task
Leverage Power BI to prepare, structure, and analyze healthcare data, and create visualizations that help guide informed decisions.

## Key Questions to Answer
1.Which diseases are most common across counties?
2.Does a higher number of patient visits always lead to higher pharmacy revenue?
3.Which departments generate the highest pharmacy costs?
4.Are there age groups that consume more medication than others?
5.Are some diagnoses associated with longer hospital stays but lower pharmacy spending?

## Dashboard Requirements
KPI cards (Total Visits, Total Pharmacy Revenue, Avg Length of Stay)
Disease trends over time
Pharmacy cost breakdown by drug category
County and department comparisons
Slicers for County, Diagnosis, Date

## Insights
Older patients tend to have more health issues, resulting in higher medication usage compared to other age groups. 
Malaria-related medications contributed the most to pharmacy revenue relative to other drugs.
March recorded a peak in the number of diagnoses, indicating higher patient activity at both the hospital and pharmacy. 
Overall, an increase in patient visits at the hospital and pharmacy corresponded with higher revenue generation.
Analysis shows that longer hospital stays are associated with greater costs and, consequently, increased revenue for the hospital.
